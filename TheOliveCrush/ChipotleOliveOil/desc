Made with UP Certified Extra Virgin Olive Oil, the smoky flavor of this chili-
infused olive oil is great for marinating steaks, in salsa, brushing on grilled
chicken, grilled or roasted vegetables or paired with seafood. Great with
shrimp, potatoes, or drizzled over warm refried beans. It makes excellent
dipping oil for artisan breads, finishing oil for soups, pasta, and rice dishes.
Try pairing with our oregano white balsamic, tangerine dark balsamic!
