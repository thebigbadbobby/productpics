Made with fresh Blood Oranges and early harvest certified organic Tunisian
olives, we crush the fresh produce together to make this beautiful (agrumato)
- a combination of whole, fresh citrus fruits crushed with early harvest olives.
Our Whole Fruit Blood Orange is exceedingly versatile; use it on fish, in
desserts, baking, with seafood, chicken, pork, fruit, salads and so much more.
Enjoy this blended with our Cranberry-Pear White Balsamic Vinegar,
grapefruit white balsamic or dark chocolate balsamic.
